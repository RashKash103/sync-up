 * single rounded shape the size and colour of the button. Sync's button stays exactly where it

 * scrolls — but draws nothing, and the surface is laid over it every frame, taking its position,
 * its scale and its fade. So it slides and fades away with the feed rather than being told to.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is allowed to take the feed down with it: every step is guarded, and Sync's
 * button is given back what it draws with if any of it fails.
