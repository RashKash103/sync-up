/**
 * What a post or a comment said before it was translated.
 *
 * <p>A translation is put in place of what was written rather than under it, so what was written
 * has to be kept somewhere or it is gone. It is kept here, against the id of the post or the
 * comment, and put back when a translation is asked for a second time.
 *
 * <p>Not in the cache beside the translations: that is a cache, emptied when the system wants
 * room and when the setting says it is old enough. Losing a translation there costs another
 * translation. Losing what was written would leave a post stuck in a language its author did not
 * write it in, with nothing to say so and no way back.
 *
 * <p>What is known about each is kept apart from the text of it: the text in a file, and beside
 * it only enough to recognise it. The line under an author asks about this as it draws, and must
 * not have to hold every translated post in memory to answer.
