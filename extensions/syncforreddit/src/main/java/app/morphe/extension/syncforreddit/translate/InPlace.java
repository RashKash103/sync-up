 * translated post is twice as long as it was, says it twice, and has a gap at the bottom.
 *
 * <p>Only the translation is written now. What was written is kept aside first, so that asking
 * to translate the same thing again puts it back, and the line under the author says which
 * language it came from while it stands translated.
