/**
 * Translating through DeepL, with a key of one's own.
 *
 * <p>Every run of words in a post goes in one request rather than one each: the service takes an
 * array and answers in the same order, and a post is a great many short runs once the links and
 * the code have been held out of it.
 *
 * <p>The markers those are held out with are sent as they are. DeepL can be asked to treat them
 * as XML tags instead, which is what its own guide suggests, but that means every angle bracket
 * and ampersand a post was written with has to be escaped on the way out and unescaped on the
 * way back — and Reddit text is full of both. The markers are carried across as plain words
 * perfectly well, and where one is not, the same check that covers the device library covers
 * this: the line is translated again in pieces.
