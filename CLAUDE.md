# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

Sync Up is a [Morphe](https://github.com/MorpheApp) patch bundle for **Sync for Reddit**
(`com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync`, plus the `.pro` and `.dev` variants). It is a derivative
of [Patcheddit](https://github.com/wchill/patcheddit), reduced to only the Sync for Reddit
patches.

Morphe is a fork of ReVanced. A patch bundle is a `.mpp` file: a JAR of Kotlin patch
definitions plus DEX'd "extension" code that gets injected into the target APK. Patches
locate methods in the obfuscated app with **fingerprints** and rewrite their smali.

## Layout

```
patches/src/main/kotlin/app/morphe/patches/
  all/misc/debugging/            Universal patch (applies to any app)
  reddit/customclients/          Reusable patch builders shared across Reddit clients
    Constants.kt                 Extension method descriptors
    SpoofClientPatch.kt          The client-id / redirect-uri / user-agent option set
    ModifyWebViewPatch.kt        Redirects WebView.loadUrl through the extension
    FixRedgifsApiPatch.kt        Enables the shared Redgifs interceptor
    FixSLinksPatch.kt            Enables the shared /s/ link resolver
    sync/                        Sync-family patches
      Constants.kt               Compatibility declarations (the supported packages)
      ads/, detection/piracy/    Shared across the Sync family; piracy detection is a
                                 dependency-only patch (it has no name, so it is not
                                 user-selectable)
      syncforreddit/             The Sync for Reddit patches themselves
        http/                    Interceptor based patches; InterceptHttpRequests installs the
                                 hook the others depend on, and has no name so it is not
                                 user-selectable
        ui/                      Patches that change Sync's own views
patches/src/main/resources/branding-license/   License texts bundled into the .mpp
extensions/shared/library/       Java injected into every patched app (shared base classes)
extensions/shared/               Wrapper project that packages the library as an extension
extensions/syncforreddit/        Sync-specific injected Java
  http/                          The interceptors, one per patch, each gated on its own
                                 isPatchIncluded so an unselected patch passes requests through
  ui/                            Code that manipulates Sync's views at runtime
extensions/syncforreddit/stub/   Compile-only stubs of app classes the extension references,
                                 declaring only the members actually used
test/test_all_apks.py            Rebuild the bundle and patch APKs dropped into test/
.github/scripts/                 README patch list generator, run by the release
```

Each patch directory pairs a `Fingerprints.kt` (how to find the code) with the patch file
(what to do to it). Follow that split when adding patches.

Extension classes must stay under `app.morphe.extension.*` — the Morphe extensions library
provides `app.morphe.extension.shared.{Logger,Utils}` and the patches reference extension
classes by their exact smali descriptor, e.g.
`Lapp/morphe/extension/syncforreddit/FixSLinksPatch;`. Renaming a package or class means
updating the descriptor string in the corresponding patch.

`extensions/*/build.gradle.kts` files are auto-discovered by the Morphe settings plugin, which
scans `extensions/` for build files. Nested projects such as `:extensions:syncforreddit:stub`
do not need to be listed in `settings.gradle.kts`.

## Commands

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Build the bundle | `./gradlew buildAndroid` → `patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp` |
| Regenerate the patch list | `./gradlew generatePatchesList` → `patches-list.json` |
| Patch real APKs | `uv run test/test_all_apks.py` (APKs go in `test/`) |
| Apply patches by hand | See [Verifying changes](#️-verifying-changes) — the only way to catch smali errors |
| Read the target APK | `uv run --with androguard==4.1.4 python ...` — see [Inspecting the APK](#inspecting-the-apk) |
| Refresh the README patch list | `uv run .github/scripts/generate_patches_readme.py RashKash103/sync-up dev patches-list.json README.md` |

Building needs **JDK 21**, an **Android SDK** with platforms 34 and 36, and a GitHub PAT with
`read:packages`, exported as `GITHUB_ACTOR` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` or set as `gpr.user` / `gpr.key`
in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`; the Morphe plugin and libraries come from GitHub Packages.
There is no `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` on this machine, and where `gh` is authenticated
`GITHUB_ACTOR=$(gh api user -q .login)` and `GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)` serve. Without them
the Morphe plugin fails to resolve and the build dies with an unhelpful
`IllegalArgumentException (no error message)` before it starts.

Use `uv run` for Python, not bare `python3`.

## ⚠️ Verifying changes

**The build passing does not mean a patch works.** There are three separate layers, and each
catches a different class of error. Skipping the later ones is how broken patches ship.

| Layer | Catches | Misses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `./gradlew buildAndroid` (and CI) | Kotlin and extension Java compile errors | Everything below |
| Running the patcher against a real APK | Smali syntax, unresolved fingerprints, register errors | Runtime behaviour |
| Installing on a device | Whether it actually works | — |

The middle layer is the one that is easy to forget and the one that hurts. **The smali inside
those Kotlin string literals is not assembled until a patch executes against an APK**, so a
malformed instruction compiles perfectly and fails only at patch time. A patch that has only
been built has not been tested in any meaningful sense.

### Measure, do not infer

Reading the app is how a patch gets written. It is not how a broken one gets diagnosed, and
mistaking the one for the other is expensive: an address in a post that would not draw as a link
took nine prereleases, and the ones that shipped a cause inferred from the bytecode were wasted,
including a patch that had to be withdrawn. The link was being made correctly every time and
thrown away afterwards, by a call that reading the code had already dismissed.

The tell is two readings that cannot both be true — a span applied to a builder, and the same
builder returning text with no spans. At that point stop reading and instrument. What settles it
is the object's own state at the moment it is used: identity (`System.identityHashCode`), the
thread, fields read by reflection rather than deduced, and `new Throwable().getStackTrace()` to
name the path that got there. Reflection over `getDeclaredFields()` by type works where names
cannot, since the app's are obfuscated and change with every build.

Make the instrument prove itself: log the first few calls unconditionally, so that a capture
showing nothing means the diagnostic is not running rather than that the code never ran. That
distinction cost two rounds on its own, once to a hook that was never reached.

### Local toolchain

None of this is in the repository; recreate it in a scratch directory as needed. It is worth
the setup time, since it turns a CI round trip into a few seconds.

1. **JDK 21** — Gradle needs it, and morphe-desktop is compiled for class file version 65.
   The system JDK may be older.
   `curl -L "https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/latest/21/ga/linux/x64/jdk/hotspot/normal/eclipse" | tar xz`
2. **Android SDK** — the extension modules are `com.android.library` projects and need
   platforms 34 and 36. Install `commandlinetools-linux`, accept the licences, then
   `sdkmanager "platforms;android-36" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"`.
   Point `ANDROID_HOME` at it.
3. **A GitHub token with `read:packages`** — the Morphe plugin and libraries come from GitHub
   Packages. Export as `GITHUB_ACTOR` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Without the scope the plugin will not
   resolve and the build fails before it starts.
4. **morphe-desktop** — the patcher, for actually applying patches. Grab the `-all.jar` from
   the latest release of `MorpheApp/morphe-desktop`.
5. **A Sync APK** — the supported build, `v23.06.30-13:39`. One is at
   `~/Downloads/sync-revanced/` on this machine.

Building and patching, with all of the above exported:

```sh
./gradlew buildAndroid                       # -> patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp
java -jar morphe-desktop.jar patch \
  -p patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp \
  -O client-id=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -e "Spoof client" \
  -e "<any patch that is off by default>" \
  --unsigned -o out.apk <the Sync APK>
```

`Spoof client` validates its `client-id` against `^[\w-]{22}$`, so any 22 character string
gets past it. The result is not a usable app, but patch application is what is being tested.
Grep the output for `Applied:` and `FAILED`.

### Inspecting the APK

Fingerprints have to be written against real bytecode, never guessed. `androguard` via
`uv run --with androguard==4.1.4` reads the DEX directly; disable its logging first with
`from loguru import logger; logger.remove()` or it floods stdout.

Two properties of Sync's build make this tractable:

- **Source file names are retained.** Classes are obfuscated (`La8/a;`), but `classDef.sourceFile`
  still says `OkHttpHelper.java`. Several existing fingerprints match on it, and it is usually
  the most stable thing available.
- **Field names often survive where method names do not.** `MaterialRow`'s setters are `d`, `k`
  and so on, but they assign `mTitle` and `mIcon`, which is how the right ones were identified.
  When a method is ambiguous, look at the fields it touches.

### Compile checking extension Java without Gradle

For a fast loop on extension code alone, compile it against the real okhttp and `android.jar`
with the Eclipse compiler (`ecj`, a single jar that runs on any JRE), stubbing the Morphe
shared library from this repository's own sources. This catches things like lambda capture of
a non-effectively-final local, or a subclass reaching a protected member through a superclass
typed reference, both of which have happened here.

### Smali gotchas

Errors found the hard way, all of which compiled cleanly and failed at patch or run time:

- **Field references need a colon**: `->fieldName:Ltype;`. Androguard prints them with a space,
  so copying its output verbatim produces `missing COLON` at patch time.
- **Check whether a type is an interface before using `invoke-interface`.** `Lxa/d;` looks like
  one but is a `public abstract` class, so it takes `invoke-virtual`. The wrong choice patches
  successfully and fails verification at runtime, which looks like an unrelated bug.
- **Check the register count** before using `v0` in injected code. `get_registers_size()` minus
  the parameters is what is free.
- **A parameter register is not still the parameter later in the method.** Sync's compiler
  reuses them as scratch locals: in `PostMoreBottomSheetFragment.o2`, `p1` holds the view that
  was passed in for exactly two instructions before it is overwritten. Injecting at the end and
  reading `p1` silently handed the extension the wrong object, and because it was still a
  `View` subclass nothing complained. Disassemble the *patched* APK and read the registers at
  the injection site rather than trusting `p1` to mean what it says.
- **Do not add a `new-instance`** to a method another patch fingerprints by counting them. The
  Redgifs fingerprint counts `NEW_INSTANCE == 1` in the method it hooks.
- **Injecting before the final `return` does not cover every path.** `Loc/b;->F` jumps from the
  middle of the method straight to the return when the view measures its text ahead of time, so
  a call placed in front of that return is never reached by the path that matters, and nothing
  is logged at all. Anchor on an instruction every path executes — the one that reads the value
  being passed around is usually it — and resolve the branch targets before choosing an index.
- **Two methods on a class can have the same signature.** `Loc/c;` has both `u()V` and `p()V`,
  so a predicate matching "no parameters, returns void, on `Loc/c;`" finds the wrong one. Anchor
  on what guards or surrounds the call instead.

## How Sync is put together

Findings from reading the APK, recorded so they do not have to be rediscovered.

**Networking.** Sync bundles a *modified* Volley whose `BasicNetwork.performRequest` builds
okhttp3 requests directly rather than using `HttpURLConnection`. It obtains its client from
`OkHttpHelper` (`La8/a;`), so a single interceptor there sees every Reddit API request. This is
what `interceptHttpRequests` hooks, anchored on `BasicNetwork` because Volley is not obfuscated,
unlike the four near identical client builders in `OkHttpHelper`.

**Images do not go through the Volley client.** Sync registers its own Glide loader in
`YourAppGlideModule` and hands it `OkHttpHelper.a()`, a *different* client again. The Glide
OkHttp integration is declared in the manifest and its `OkHttpUrlLoader$Factory` builds a
client of its own, but Sync's registration supersedes it, so hooking that one alone does
nothing. Anything touching images has to hook the client passed in `YourAppGlideModule`.
That class keeps its name, since Glide's generated code refers to it.

There are at least three distinct OkHttp clients in play: Volley's, Glide's, and the several
`OkHttpHelper` builds for other purposes. Before assuming an interceptor will see a request,
find out which client actually issues it.

**Requests are Volley `Request` subclasses**, one per endpoint, named for what they do
(`OAuthCommentsRequest`, `GrabRedgifRequest`, `ImgurGalleryRequest`). They parse with
`org.json`, and Sync reads raw markdown: `body` and `selftext`, never `body_html`. It has no
`removed_by_category` field at all.

**Thread URLs are `/r/<sub>/comments/<id>/_/...json`** against `oauth.reddit.com`. Patcheddit's
Boost patches match `^https?://\w+\.reddit\.com/comments/`, which never fires on Sync.

**Menus are layouts, not lists.** The post overflow sheet is
`res/layout/dialog_bottom_post_more.xml`, a `LinearLayout` of `MaterialRow` views dispatched by
`view.getId()` in `onItemClicked`. Adding an entry the way Boost does is not possible; rows are
built and inserted at runtime instead, which avoids introducing an id resource.

**Text is built, then handed to a view.** `Loc/c;` is a builder: characters in a `StringBuilder`
and a list of spans beside them. `Loc/c;->d()` returns a `SpannableString` when that list holds
anything and a plain `String` when it does not. `Loc/b;` is the text view that reads it — `A()`
hands back the builder *after resetting it*, `F()` takes the built text and sets it. Sync finds
its own tappable spans in `Loc/b;->onTouchEvent` through the `Lnb/a;` interface, which the link
span `Lmb/d;` implements. `Lmb/d;` paints with nothing but the view's `textColorLink` and adds no
underline, so a link that has lost its span is indistinguishable from the words around it.

**A preview is drawn in full and then stripped.** `Lnc/d;->c()` runs the SAX parse and, when
`Lnc/a;->d` is set, finishes by calling `Loc/c;->p()`, which drops every span and keeps the
characters. `Lnc/a;->c()` sets that flag, and it is the option set used by both
`SimpleSelftextPreviewTextView` and `CardSelftextPreviewTextView`, so a post's body was drawn as
inert text in every layout until `keepSelftextLinksPatch`. `SimpleHolder` draws the post header
in `CommentsActivity` as well as feed rows, so the post screen was affected too, and Sync's
`slideSelftextPreviews` setting only chooses between two paths that both end at the strip.

**Interceptors must not assume how a response is labelled or written.** A rewrite that reached
threads was skipping listings, and either of two guards could account for it; Reddit no longer
answers the API unauthenticated, so which one it was could not be established, and both were
dropped. Do not gate on `Content-Type` being `application/json` — the undelete interceptor asks
nothing about the kind and works on every listing — and let a regex over a body tolerate `\/`,
since JSON may escape the slashes in a URL. Writing them back unescaped is valid either way.

**Dead endpoints Sync still calls.** Worth knowing before diagnosing a media bug:

- `api.gfycat.com` and `gfycat.com` — DNS no longer resolves at all.
- `api.redgifs.com/info` — 404, removed. Sync calls it first when opening a RedGifs link.
- `ap.syncforreddit.com` — Sync's own proxy, still up but answers 401. Feed autoplay routes
  RedGifs and gfycat through it when the `enhancedAutoPlay` setting is on.

## Version pinning

`gradle/libs.versions.toml` pins Morphe Patcher `1.3.3` and morphe-patches-library
`1.0.2-dev.2`, which is what Patcheddit was last built against (April 2026). Current upstream
is far ahead — patcher `1.11.x`, library `1.6.x`. **This is deliberate**: the ported patch
sources were written against the older API, and pinning keeps them compilable.

Modernising the dependency stack is the largest known follow-up. It is an API migration, not a
version bump, and it should be done as its own change with a real build behind it. `morphe-patcher`
and `smali` are read out of the version catalog by the Gradle plugin and are not listed under
`[libraries]`, so Dependabot will not propose those bumps.

## Relationship to Patcheddit

The patch logic is a faithful port. Where this repository intentionally differs:

- Only Sync for Reddit is targeted. All other client patches, the Sync for Lemmy target, and
  the shared code only those used, are dropped.
- Patches with no Patcheddit equivalent, written for problems specific to Sync: the RedGifs
  `/info` emulation and the Gfycat to RedGifs redirect. Both came out of endpoints Sync depends
  on that no longer exist.
- The Boost patches that were worth porting are reworked rather than copied, because Sync
  differs at every hook point: no JRAW, a different thread URL shape, raw markdown instead of
  the `_html` fields, Glide on its own client, and a layout driven menu. `org.json` is used
  rather than Jackson, and caches are in memory rather than Room, so the bundle takes on no new
  dependencies.
- Boost's *Fix audio in downloads* is not ported: Sync has its own MPD parser fix. Its
  */r/all* patch is not ported either; it addresses a Boost specific bug, and there is no
  evidence Sync has it.
- Identity: project name, `rootProject.name`, the bundle `about` block, and Gradle group
  (`app.syncup`) are this project's. Required by the upstream Section 7 name restrictions.
- The `Spoof client` option help text says "Sync Up documentation" rather than the upstream
  project's name.
- Release plumbing follows the current
  [morphe-patches-template](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches-template) rather than
  Patcheddit's older setup: `.releaserc`, `release.yml`, `open_pull_request.yml`,
  `package.json`, and the README patch list generator all come from there. No GPG signing is
  configured, so `signatureUrlTemplate` is empty.
- `patches/api/patches.api`, the settings and `addresources` resource trees, and the unused
  `:patches:stub` project are not carried over. The API dump was stale upstream; the resources
  belong to settings patches this bundle does not use.
- `test/test_all_apks.py` points at `morphe-desktop` (morphe-cli was renamed), tolerates a
  missing `test/config.json`, and carries a PEP 723 header.

When porting a fix from upstream, keep the `Copyright 2026 wchill` headers on ported files —
that attribution is what the upstream license requires.

## Licensing constraints

GPLv3 with Section 7 conditions inherited from **both** Patcheddit and Morphe; the full text
is in [NOTICE](NOTICE). Two things constrain the code:

- **7c name restriction.** Do not name this project, its bundle, or its branding after
  "Patcheddit" or "Morphe". Descriptive references ("compatible with Morphe", "derived from
  Patcheddit") are fine. Note that `app.morphe.*` package names and the
  `PatchedditInterceptor` class name are inherited identifiers in ported code, not project
  identity — leave them alone.
- **7b attribution.** Both upstream notices must stay reachable: `NOTICE`, the README license
  section, and the license texts bundled into the `.mpp` under
  `patches/src/main/resources/branding-license/`.

## Conventions

- Semantic commit messages; the release version and changelog are generated from them.
  `feat:` minor, `fix:`/`bump:`/`perf:` patch, `chore:` no release.
- Work on `dev`. `main` is stable releases only, reached by merging `dev` (not squashing).
- **Squash the steps of a fix before `main` sees them.** A bug that took several attempts
  belongs in the stable changelog as the fix that worked, not as the attempts: `main` is merged
  rather than squashed, so every commit on `dev` reaches the notes. Prefer not creating the
  noise in the first place — ship an attempt on `build(Needs bump):`, which publishes a
  prerelease and is hidden from the notes, and keep `fix:`/`feat:` for the version confirmed to
  work. Where attempts have already gone out under those types, fold them together on `dev`
  before opening the merge. Rewriting commits that have already been released strands the git
  notes semantic-release keys by commit SHA (`refs/notes/semantic-release-*`), and the next
  release fails until they are re-attached, so squash before the prerelease that supersedes
  them rather than after.
- **Diagnostics go on `chore:` commits.** Because `main` is merged rather than squashed, every
  commit on `dev` appears in the stable changelog, and a release that reads as six entries about
  a diagnostic that no longer exists is worse than no entry at all. A patch written to answer a
  question is `default = false` while it exists and is deleted once it has answered, before the
  release that would ship it. A `chore:` commit publishes nothing, so a diagnostic that has to
  reach a device goes on `build(Needs bump):`, which releases a prerelease and is hidden from
  the notes — the scope has to be exactly that for `.releaserc` to match it.
- **Patch descriptions are one or two sentences of what the patch does.** They are read in the
  manager by someone choosing patches, not by someone maintaining them: no reasoning about why
  the patch exists, no account of what was learnt writing it. The detail — what a patch changes
  and where it stops — goes in the hand-written *What the patches do* section of `README.md`,
  below the `PATCHES_END` marker.
- **No toasts in a stable release.** `Logger.printException` raises one; anything on a hot path
  or a transient network failure uses `printInfo` instead. Toasts are acceptable in a prerelease
  being tested.
- Never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`, `patches-list.json`, `patches-bundle.json`, or the region
  between the `PATCHES_START` / `PATCHES_END` markers in `README.md`. The release writes them.
- Do not create releases by hand.

## Known rough edges

Inherited from upstream, deliberately left alone in the initial import:

- `ModifyWebViewPatch.kt` has a leftover `println` in its execute block.
- `Constants.kt` in `reddit/customclients/` still declares `CREATE_NEW_CLIENT_METHOD`, which
  no remaining patch uses.
- The `sync/ads/DisableAdsPatch.kt` builder plus its `syncforreddit/ads` wrapper is now an
  indirection with a single caller, since the Lemmy target is gone.

Current, from this project's own patches:

- Tapping an archive row in the post menu opens the browser but does not dismiss the sheet.
  Dismissing needs a reference to the fragment and an androidx.fragment dependency the
  extension does not currently have.
- The undelete patches call Arctic Shift and the Wayback Machine, both free community
  services. Results are cached and only fetched when a thread actually contains removed
  content. Keep it that way; do not add speculative prefetching.
- Restored text is marked by a coloured note appended to the line under the author, built with
  Sync's own header builder, because Sync has no equivalent of the model field Boost renders its
  markers in. The wording comes from Reddit's own placeholder (`[ Removed by moderator ]`), so
  it says what actually happened rather than guessing.
